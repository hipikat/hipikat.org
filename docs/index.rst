   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Hipikat.org's documentation!
=======================================

Hipikat.org is the personal website belonging to me â€“ Adam Wright. It's built
in Django and the design uses Zurb Foundation. I make it open source, release
it under an MIT license and write this documentation:

- For the interest of developers integrating the same or similar components
- Due to mild communist tendencies
- To remind myself how it works once I've forgotten, and want to change it
- I enjoy fastidiously documenting things
- As a live portfolio for potential future employers and co-conspirators.

Here i am referencing Python's ``enumerate()`` function:

.. py:function:: enumerate(sequence[, start=0])

   Return an iterator that yields tuples of an index and an item of the
      *sequence*. (And so on.)

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2



Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
