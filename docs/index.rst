Welcome to the Hipikat.org docs!
================================

Hipikat.org is a personal website belonging to me â€“ Adam Wright. It's built in
the Python_ web framework Django_ and the design uses `Zurb Foundation`_. I
make the site open source, release it under an `MIT license`_ and write this
documentation:

.. _Python: http://python.org
.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com
.. _Zurb Foundation: http://foundation.zurb.com
.. _MIT License: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

- For the interest of developers integrating the same or similar components
- Due to mild communist tendencies
- To remind myself how it works once I've forgotten, and need to change things
- Because I enjoy fastidiously documenting things
- As a portfolio and demonstration of some technologies that interest me.

My settings make use of the :py:func:`execfile` things and :django:automodule:`django.db.models`.
