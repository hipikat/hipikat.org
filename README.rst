Hipikat.org
===========

**This site is still under development and not yet live. :)**

Source code for Adam Wright's personal website at http:/hipikat.org/. I
put this online:

* As a portfolio; everything here is my own work (except where stated otherwise)
* So I can point to concepts I'm explaining, and as examples for those like me
* The public eye makes me accountable
* The public eye keeps private data out of the repository :)
* Version control makes repositories journals of personal development for developers
* For those cute little green dots on my GitHub 'Your Contributions' panel.

Particularly, the code here shows how an integration of the following
'full stack' of web technologies can be drawn together:

* `Zepto`_ - The aerogel-weight jQuery-compatible JavaScript library
* `Zurb Foundation 4`_ - A front-end, responsive framework
    * Sass_ - Syntactially awesome style sheets
* Django_ - A Python web framework open source Python modules
    * django-hosts_ - Subdomain routing for Django projects
    * TODO: list other django apps used

.. _`Zurb Foundation 4`: http://foundation.zurb.com
.. _SASS: http://sass-lang.com
.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com
.. _django-hosts: http://django-hosts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

As well as open source packages I've created:

* django-revkom_ - My library for in vitro, generic, not-yet-packaged code
* django-cinch_ - An app for class-based Django settings
* django-slater_ - A small suite of debugging tools for Django.

Other tools involved in the creation of the site include PostgreSQL_,
Git_, Vim_, and and 11-inch, Mid 2011 MacBook Air.

TODO: Get deployment working with Salt Stack? Maybe with Vagrant?
More tests.
