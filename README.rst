===========

Source code for Adam Wright's personal website at http:/hipikat.org/. I
put this online:

* As a type of portfolio; everything here is my own work (where not
  explicitly credited otherwise)
* So I can point people to concepts I'm explaining, as I've implemented
  them
* Unabashedly, for the little green dots on my GitHub 'Your
  Contributions' panel.

Particularly, the code here shows how an integration of the following
'full stack' of web technologies can be drawn together:

* `Zurb Foundation 4`_ - A front-end, responsive framework
    * Sass_ - Syntactially awesome style sheets
* Django_ - A Python web framework
    * django-revkom_ - the author's main Django app for useful generic code.
    * django-crispy-forms
* Zurb Foundation 4
    * SASS
